# Demo application for React Query

This project is a demo application for [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/), a library used to manage server sate on React and React Native applications.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To start the demo, first run `json-server` :

```
npm run json-server
```

It will start a small API server on `3004` port.

Then start the application :

```
npm start
```
